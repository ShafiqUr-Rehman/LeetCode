<h2>reverse-integer Notes</h2><hr>Certainly! Let's walk through the code and perform a dry run with an example input.

We have a function reverse that takes an integer x as input and returns its reverse. Here's how it works:

Initialize a variable reversed to store the reversed integer. Start with reversed = 0.
Start a while loop that continues until x becomes 0.
Inside the loop:
Get the last digit of x using pop = x % 10.
Update x by removing its last digit: x /= 10.
Check for overflow or underflow:
If adding the new digit to reversed would cause overflow (greater than INT_MAX/10) or if it's equal to INT_MAX/10 and the new digit is greater than the last digit of INT_MAX, return 0.
If adding the new digit to reversed would cause underflow (less than INT_MIN/10) or if it's equal to INT_MIN/10 and the new digit is less than the last digit of INT_MIN, return 0.
Update reversed by multiplying it by 10 and adding the new digit.
Return the reversed integer.
Now, let's do a dry run with an example, say x = 123.

reversed = 0, x = 123.
Inside the loop:
pop = 123 % 10 = 3, x = 12.
No overflow or underflow checks needed.
reversed = 0 * 10 + 3 = 3.
Next iteration:
pop = 12 % 10 = 2, x = 1.
No overflow or underflow checks needed.
reversed = 3 * 10 + 2 = 32.
Next iteration:
pop = 1 % 10 = 1, x = 0.
No overflow or underflow checks needed.
reversed = 32 * 10 + 1 = 321.
Since x is now 0, the loop ends, and reversed (which is 321) is returned.
This function will correctly reverse integers while handling overflow and underflow cases.
